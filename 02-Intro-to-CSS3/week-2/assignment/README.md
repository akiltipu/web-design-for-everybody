#Instructions
In this assignment you will take my HTML code and create a single html file called hw1.css.  It should style the page following the guidelines provided.  You can see an example final product at http://www.intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/index.jpg
 
##Steps:

1) Download the image from http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/images/flywheel.jpg and put it into a folder named images. 

2) Style the following: 
The body should have padding and margin 
The header should have a background color, background image (using a local image), and padding 
The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, and padding 
The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other links (using class = "active') 
The sections should be next to each other, not one on top of the other. 
The images should be part of the page now. In addition, they should have a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between them and the other images.
